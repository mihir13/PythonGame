# PythonGame
This is a basic game created on Python for Single Player using player and enemy rectangles. </br> It works pretty simple, it is a survival game and all you have to do is avoid colliding enemy boxes. </br> Once the collision happens, the game quits. Unfortunately on Mac it does have a delay but may not for Windows.
